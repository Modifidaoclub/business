# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

factory contract address 0xA8A10A438baEF222dc19797fb73389ADd2e8fa9c
main contract address 0xc5e43a58eacdf98792798e8cd1fd7ddabbee53c6
